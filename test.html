        London, on 24 May, 1819. She was the only daughter of Edward, Duke of
        Kent, fourth son of George III. Her father died shortly after her birth
        and she became heir to the throne because the three uncles who were ahead
        of her in the succession - George IV, Frederick Duke of York, and William
        IV - had no legitimate children who survived.</p>
